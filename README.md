# BrainF In Python
I remade the BrainF*** Esolang in Python

You can find the original code on [GitHub](https://github.com/fabianishere/brainfuck).

Mine obviously isnt as good, I just thought it was a fun idea

### Disclaimer
This version of BrainF will not run loops inside loops.
I am sorry for the inconvenience, but if you want it so bad, then go download the real version.

## Installation
### Linux

To download on Linux, clone the repository. You will need all of the files, so don't delete them.
If you clicked the download zip button, then you will need to extract the folder before you can continue.
In the terminal, change directory so that you are in BrainF-In-Python/build/Linux
```bash
cd BrainF-In-Python/build/Linux
```

Then run this command.
```bash
chmod +x build.sh
```

This will allow you to run the file.
Next you can run the build file
```bash
./build.sh
```

Once this has finished, you can delete the repo; Unless you want to use the examples.

To run the program, type "brain" followed by your file name.
If this does not work, try opening up a new terminal, or running the command ```bash
source ~/.bashrc```
