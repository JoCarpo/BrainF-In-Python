# BrainF-In-Python
I remade the BrainF*** Esolang in Python

You can find the original code on GitHub

Mine obviously isnt as good, I just thought it was a fun idea

I am working on improving, like making an installer in the future,
but for now you just have to run the src/main.py file, followed by the file name
